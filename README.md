# ICBCAutoScheduler
this is a selenium + python script to check for the next available booking for road tests
see license blah blah blah use at your own risk
## I gave up on this project it works if you have a booking already, but it gets stuck when you try to search for a location I don't know how to fix
the goal is to refresh it and send you the available bookings (cancellations) so you don't have to log in and check, and instead have it printed by terminal.
